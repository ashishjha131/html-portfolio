<h1>The Best Movies/Web Series According to Ashish</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Re Zero</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime of all time after Attack on Titan, but because it is so underrated I had to keep it.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Really cool ending.</p>
<h3>Chandni Chowk to China</h3>
<p>My favourite Indian movie, way ahead of its time, the audience didnt't deserve that.</p>
